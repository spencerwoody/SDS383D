  abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE)
	technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future
	for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental
	data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves
	determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript
	or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions.
	edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential
	expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model
	is used to account for both biological and technical variability.
	Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion
	across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology
	can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
	at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The
	software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such
	as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely
	available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).},

abstract="The analysis of gene expression from time series underpins many biological studies. Two basic forms of analysis recur for data of this type: removing inactive (quiet) genes from the study and determining which genes are differentially expressed. Often these analysis stages are applied disregarding the fact that the data is drawn from a time series. In this paper we propose a simple model for accounting for the underlying temporal nature of the data based on a Gaussian process.",

    abstract = {Author Summary Bacteria frequently experience starvation conditions in their natural environments. Yet how they modify their physiology in response to these conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we performed a detailed, two-week starvation experiment in E. coli. We exhaustively monitored changes in cellular components, such as RNA and protein abundances, over time. We subsequently compared and contrasted these measurements using novel computational approaches we developed specifically for analyzing gene-expression time-course data. Using these approaches, we could identify systematic trends in the E. coli starvation response. In particular, we found that cells systematically limit mRNA and protein production, degrade proteins involved in energy-intensive processes, and maintain or increase the amount of proteins involved in energy production. Thus, the bacteria assume a cellular state in which their ongoing energy use is limited while they are poised to take advantage of any nutrients that may become available.},
